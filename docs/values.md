# Values cascade

Every Application renders its element chart with an ordered list of values files. The cluster's labels choose the files, and later files override earlier ones. The ApplicationSet builds the list in the `templatePatch` of [appset.yaml](https://github.com/PolicyStack/PolicyStack/blob/main/appset/templates/appset.yaml).

## Order

Lowest precedence first. Paths are relative to `stack/<element>`, the Application's source path.

1. `values.yaml`: the element defaults.
2. `../../values.yaml`: the repo root, shared by every element. It sets `policyNamespace`.
3. `../../values/<category>s/<value>.yaml`, one per `config.<baseDomain>/<category>.<priority>=<value>` label, in sort-key order. The directory is the category name plus `s`: `tenant` maps to `values/tenants/`.
4. The cluster's own files:
    - On the hub (`local-cluster` label): `../../values/acm/acm-<datacenter>.yaml`, then `../../values/clusters/acm-<datacenter>.yaml`.
    - On any other cluster: `../../values/clusters/<cluster>.yaml`, where `<cluster>` is the ManagedCluster name.
5. `valuesObject`, the keys the ApplicationSet [injects](applicationset.md#injected-values). Argo CD ranks it above every values file.

The sort key for a config label is `printf "%05s-%s-%s"` of its priority, category and value. The keys sort as text (`sortAlpha`):

- The priority is zero-padded to five characters, so `10` becomes `00010` and priorities 1 to 99999 sort numerically. Longer numbers get no padding and sort as text: `100000` loads before `20000`.
- Equal priorities sort by category name, then by value: `region.40` loads before `tenant.40`.
- Environment and datacenter have no fixed slots. They sort like any other category, so `datacenter.5` loads before `environment.10`.
- A config label with no `.<priority>` suffix adds no file.

[Cluster labels](applicationset.md#cluster-labels) lists the repo's priority convention.

## Missing files

The ApplicationSet sets `ignoreMissingValueFiles: true`, so Argo CD skips any listed file that does not exist at the cluster's revision. A layer needs a file only where it changes something.

The same setting hides mistakes. Each of these drops a layer without an error, and the Application syncs from the remaining files:

- A typo in a label's category or value, which points at a file that does not exist.
- A cluster file whose name differs from the ManagedCluster name.

Elements default to off, so a dropped layer usually shows up as an element that never turns on. Compare the Application's value files with the repo at the cluster's revision:

```sh
oc get applications.argoproj.io infra-nodes-prod-east-1 -n openshift-gitops \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.helm.valueFiles}'
```

## Merge rules

Helm merges the files in order.

- **Maps merge** key by key. A later file sets only the keys it changes: [nonprod-west-1.yaml](https://github.com/PolicyStack/PolicyStack/blob/main/values/clusters/nonprod-west-1.yaml) sets `retention` and `storage` under `stack.userWorkloadMonitoring.config.prometheus`, and the element defaults supply the rest.
- **Lists replace.** A later list overwrites the whole earlier list: [dc2.yaml](https://github.com/PolicyStack/PolicyStack/blob/main/values/datacenters/dc2.yaml) restates the element's default registries next to its mirror.

An element's policy entries are a list, so a layer cannot change one entry without restating them all. It flips an entry through the [`toggles`](https://github.com/PolicyStack/PolicyStack-chart/blob/main/charts/policy-library/README.md#toggles) map instead, and settings go in the `config` map that the element's converters read ([Conventions](elements.md#conventions)).

## Layout

```text

values.yaml                    shared by every element: policyNamespace
values/
├── environments/   nonprod.yaml  prod.yaml
├── datacenters/    dc1.yaml  dc2.yaml
├── platforms/      aws.yaml  baremetal.yaml  vmware.yaml
├── tenants/        payments.yaml

└── clusters/       acm-dc1.yaml  aws-prod.yaml  nonprod-west-1.yaml  prod-east-1.yaml
```

## Example files

The files under [values/](https://github.com/PolicyStack/PolicyStack/tree/main/values) configure the example clusters. They are a starting point, not a complete configuration. Every element ships with `enabled: false`, and the layer that should run an element turns it on. Labels are shown without the `config.example.com/` prefix.

| File | Selected by | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `values/environments/prod.yaml` | `environment.10=prod` | The security and compliance baseline for every prod cluster: cert-manager, External Secrets, the Compliance Operator, manual remediations and cluster DNS |
| `values/environments/nonprod.yaml` | `environment.10=nonprod` | Placeholder, sets nothing |
| `values/datacenters/dc1.yaml` | `datacenter.20=dc1` | Placeholder, sets nothing |
| `values/datacenters/dc2.yaml` | `datacenter.20=dc2` | Site facts only: the registry allowlist through the dc2 mirror. Turns no element on |
| `values/platforms/aws.yaml` | `platform.30=aws` | Toggles for the node elements: clone the worker MachineSet |
| `values/platforms/vmware.yaml` | `platform.30=vmware` | Toggles for the node elements: clone each worker MachineSet, one per vSphere failure domain |
| `values/platforms/baremetal.yaml` | `platform.30=baremetal` | Toggles for the node elements: no infra MachineSets, and storage nodes are existing nodes labeled in place |
| `values/tenants/payments.yaml` | `tenant.40=payments` | A custom category: the GitOps operator without its instance, plus a payments team Argo CD |
| `values/acm/acm-dc1.yaml` | The hub in dc1 | Reserved for the hub's own ACM and GitOps elements. Left commented out so PolicyStack does not reconcile its own delivery path |
| `values/clusters/acm-dc1.yaml` | The hub in dc1 | The hub's elements, and a commented list of the elements left off and why |
| `values/clusters/prod-east-1.yaml` | ManagedCluster `prod-east-1` | Infra nodes, machine health checks, an update channel pin and user workload monitoring |
| `values/clusters/nonprod-west-1.yaml` | ManagedCluster `nonprod-west-1` | Enforces the dc2 registry allowlist, the cluster's own MetalLB address pool, and user workload monitoring |
| `values/clusters/aws-prod.yaml` | ManagedCluster `aws-prod` | Values for an AWS test cluster: the OpenShift Data Foundation to Loki storage chain and additional operator installs. Rename it to the target ManagedCluster name before use, its header lists the labels it expects |

CI renders every element with the files the validator's fixture clusters select ([Validation](validation.md)). None of them selects `vmware.yaml`, `payments.yaml` or `aws-prod.yaml`, so CI never reads them.

## Worked example

These labels on `prod-east-1` select its files:

```text
git.example.com/revision=<branch-or-tag>
config.example.com/environment.10=prod
config.example.com/datacenter.20=dc1
config.example.com/platform.30=aws
```

The sort keys are `00010-environment-prod`, `00020-datacenter-dc1` and `00030-platform-aws`. For the `infra-nodes` element, the ApplicationSet creates the Application `infra-nodes-prod-east-1` with these files:

```yaml
valueFiles:
  - values.yaml
  - ../../values.yaml
  - ../../values/environments/prod.yaml
  - ../../values/datacenters/dc1.yaml
  - ../../values/platforms/aws.yaml
  - ../../values/clusters/prod-east-1.yaml
```

The environment and datacenter files set nothing for this element. The merged `stack.infraNodes`, trimmed:

```yaml
enabled: true                 # clusters/prod-east-1.yaml
toggles:
  mcp: true                   # element default
  config: true                # element default
  aws: true                   # platforms/aws.yaml
  vmware: false               # platforms/aws.yaml
  ready: true                 # element default
  workloads: false            # element default
  restore: false              # element default
config:
  replicas: 1                 # clusters/prod-east-1.yaml
  zones:                      # clusters/prod-east-1.yaml, replaces the default []
    - us-east-1a
    - us-east-1b
    - us-east-1c
  instanceType: m6i.2xlarge   # clusters/prod-east-1.yaml
  # every other config key keeps its element default
```

`valuesObject` then adds the one-cluster `selector` and the `selected*` keys.

The dc1 hub carries `local-cluster=true` and these labels:

```text
git.example.com/revision=<branch-or-tag>
config.example.com/environment.10=prod
config.example.com/datacenter.20=dc1
config.example.com/platform.30=baremetal
```

For `node-feature-discovery`, the Application is `node-feature-discovery-acm-dc1`:

```yaml
valueFiles:
  - values.yaml
  - ../../values.yaml
  - ../../values/environments/prod.yaml
  - ../../values/datacenters/dc1.yaml
  - ../../values/platforms/baremetal.yaml
  - ../../values/acm/acm-dc1.yaml
  - ../../values/clusters/acm-dc1.yaml
```

`values/clusters/acm-dc1.yaml` turns the element on. The hub's files are named after its datacenter label, not its ManagedCluster name, so `values/clusters/local-cluster.yaml` is never read.
